The casing of leaves protects the washed-rind disc and allows the young, slightly acidic cheese to remain moist. It also imparts a fresh vegetable flavour with a hint of wine.

Today, however, a very small percentage of producers make cheese from raw milk with the same process as Marie Harel would have used. Those that do produce cheese using this method can legally call their cheese Camembert Normandie under the AOC guidelines. However, the production of Camembert cheese has now transcended the AOC designation. Very good varieties of Camembert cheese made from pasteurised milk can be found in Normandy today. The best of them is the Camembert Le Chtelain. The fresh Camembert cheese is bland, hard and crumbly in texture when fresh. As the cheese matures it forms a smooth, runny interior and a white bloomy rind that is typical to Camenbert cheese. It has a rich, buttery flavour. The rind is bloomy white caused by a white fungus, called penicillium candidum. It is meant to be eaten with the cheese. This cheese is best paired with a light red wine such as Beaujolais, C",

Depending on their age, the flavour, texture and aroma of a cheddar cheese can vary. Cheddar is traditionally creamy white in colour but due to the addition of tasteless food colouring, it often appears dyed in an orange hue. The cheese can be made from raw, pasteurised or thermalized milk to retain more of the flavour-enhancing enzymes.

     "description":"Coolea is a cow's milk cheese produced on the farm of Dick and Sinead Willems in Coolea Co. Cork. Made since 1979, this Gouda style cheese has a yellow / orange wax with firm, closed texture and smooth pate. As the cheese matures, the pate becomes drier and finally the protein crystals are visible at 18 months of maturity. Young Coolea is mild and buttery developing sweeter and caramel notes by 12 months. With further ripening, the flavours deepen and intensify which gives the cheese its characteristic toffee taste. The cheese is sold in three stages: Young Coolea available from 3 months, Mature Coolea available from 12 months and extra mature from 18 months. Coolea has won several awards including Best Matured Gouda in the World Cheese Awards 2008 and Supreme Champion at the Listowel Food Fair in 2008 and 2009. It pairs well with Alsace Pinot Gris.

Traditionally, Cotija cheese was made with raw milk aged for three to twelve months. But the commercial productions add an enzyme to speed up the ripening process. This need for acceleration gives the commercial produce a slight change in flavour compared to the artisanal variety. Since, Cotija cheese is very salty, strongly flavoured, firm and does not actually melt, it is used for grating on salads, soups, casseroles, tacos, tostadas and chili.

The solution was Dry Jack, a hard cheese, aged from ten months to upto four years. Firm in texture with a pale yellow pate, the cheese has a rich, nutty yet mild and assertive flavour. As the cheese ages Dry Jack wheels become increasingly brittle.

To set it apart from cheddar and highlight the quality of cheese, Leicester is coloured with a vegetable dye called annatto.The rind is reddish-orange with a powdery mould on it. The colour indicates that the milk used has a high cream content. Today, only a a couple of farms in Leicestershire makes the cheese using traditional methods and raw milk.

     "description":"Neufchatel is a traditional, soft-white, table cheese, originating from the village of Neufchtel-en-Bray in northern Normandy. Made from cows milk, it is one of Frances oldest cheeses, dating back as far as 1035. The cheese is made in many forms, shapes and sizes - bonde (cylinders), coeur (heart shape), carre (square shape) and briquette (brick shape). Legend goes that French farm girls fell in love with English soldiers during the Hundred Years War and started making heart shaped cheeses to show their love. Granted AOC status in 1969, Neufchatel can be industrial, farmstead or artisanal. Artisanal Neufchatel has a grainy, close textured and thick paste covered with a soft, downy, velvety bloomy rind. Matured for 810 weeks, the taste and texture is reminiscent of a Camembert; mushroomy, rich, nutty and slightly yeasty. Other French cheeses: Top photos from Twitter",

Made from cows milk, it is enriched with cream so that it contains at least 40% fat content. The 30g version of the cheese is called Petit-Suisse while larger packagings are referred to as a double Suisse, double petit-suisse or suisse double.

     "description":"Venaco is a washed rind cheese produced from raw, whole sheeps milk, though some shepherds use goats milk. It is produced in the mountainous regions of Haute Corsica using natural rennet. The name of the cheese is derived from a village called Venaco that lies in the centre of the island. The cheese is matured for 1-2 weeks before it dipped in brine and left to mature in a moist cheese cellar. The rind of the cheese is red-orange in colour while the insides reveal an ivory soft pate. A 24-48 hours fresh variant can sometimes be used for cooking but essentially 2-3 months matured Venaco makes a perfect addition to a cheese platter. At 6 months, an intensely mature Venaco can be used as a grating cheese on pastas and soups. The aroma of Venaco is complex, complemented by a powerful, melt-in-the-mouth taste. A great place to try Corsican cheeses is at the Venaco cheese fair, , in early May. Venaco is fremiers cheeses that have to be produced from the milk of a single herd. Other French c",
